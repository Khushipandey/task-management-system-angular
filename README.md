# 🗂️ Task Manager - Get Things Done, Beautifully!

Welcome to Task Manager, your new best friend for taming the wild chaos of tasks!
Built with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.1 + TailwindCSS, this app is fast, clean, and alarmingly productive.

## 🚀 Features That Make Life Better

📝 Add Tasks — Title + Due Date mandatory (because chaos needs rules).

✏️ Edit Tasks — Regret nothing. Update anything.

❌ Delete Tasks — Because not every idea is a good idea.

🔎 Filter by Status — See only what you want: Pending, In Progress, Completed.

📅 Sort by Due Date — Because deadlines aren't suggestions.

📊 Dashboard Summary — Instant counts of your tasks at a glance.

🔀 Client-side Routing — Toggle between All Tasks and Completed Tasks faster than your mood swings.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood (And It's Juicy)

Angular 17: Standalone components for a standalone attitude.

TailwindCSS: Tailwinded our way to a beautiful UI.

RxJS: Reactive streams that even a river would be jealous of.

Mock API (MockDB): All the realism, none of the backend headaches.
